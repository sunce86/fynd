# Hindsight

Hindsight measures how Fynd would have performed on **real, settled aggregator swaps**. For each
block it decodes the aggregator trades that actually executed on-chain, re-solves the same
`(token_in, token_out, amount_in)` through Fynd, and compares Fynd's output against what settled.

It is the live counterpart to the `fynd-benchmark audit` tool: where `audit` compares Fynd against
other aggregators' *quotes*, Hindsight compares Fynd against what those aggregators *actually
delivered* on-chain.

## Build

```bash
cargo build -p hindsight --release
```

The binary is `hindsight`. Run any subcommand with `--help` for the full option list.

## Subcommands

### `decode` — decode settled aggregator swaps

Decodes every aggregator trade that settled in a block (or range) straight from on-chain data over
a standard RPC. No external data provider is required.

```bash
hindsight decode --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --block 21000000
hindsight decode --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --range 21000000-21000010 --json
```

Each decoded trade carries two levels of attribution (see [Methodology](#methodology)): the
**client** that initiated the trade and the **aggregator** that settled it.

### `verify` — check the decoder against Allium

Decodes a block locally and diffs every transaction against [Allium](https://docs.allium.so/)'s
`aggregator_trades` ground-truth dataset (tokens, amounts in bps, aggregator attribution),
producing a worklist of gaps and mismatches.

```bash
hindsight verify --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" \
  --allium-key "$ALLIUM_API_KEY" \
  --range 21000000-21000010 \
  --tolerance-bps 50
```

### `resolve` — re-solve through Fynd and compare

Decodes a block's trades and re-solves each through a **running Fynd instance**, reporting how
Fynd compares to what settled.

```bash
# Requires a healthy Fynd solver reachable at --fynd-url.
hindsight resolve \
  --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" \
  --fynd-url http://localhost:3000 \
  --range 21000000-21000005

# Serve Prometheus metrics while running (keeps serving until ctrl-c):
hindsight resolve --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --range 21000000-21000005 --metrics-port 9899
```

Output is a terminal win/loss summary, or structured data with `--json`. This compares at the
chain's current state.

## Configuration

| Variable / flag | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ETH_RPC_URL` / `--rpc-url` | all | Ethereum RPC endpoint for decoding |
| `FYND_URL` / `--fynd-url` | `resolve` | Base URL of a running Fynd solver (default `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `ALLIUM_API_KEY` / `--allium-key` | `verify` | Allium API key |
| `--chain` | `resolve` | Chain label applied to metrics (default `ethereum`) |
| `--metrics-port` | `resolve` | Serve Prometheus `/metrics` on this port |
| `--timeout-ms` | `resolve` | Per-quote timeout for Fynd (default `10000`) |

## Metrics & dashboard

With `--metrics-port`, `resolve` exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`:

| Metric | Type | Labels |
|---|---|---|
| `hindsight_trades_total` | counter | `client`, `aggregator`, `pair`, `chain`, `outcome` |
| `hindsight_savings_bps` | histogram | `client`, `aggregator`, `chain` |
| `hindsight_savings_usd` | histogram | `client`, `aggregator`, `chain` |
| `hindsight_coverage_ratio` | gauge | — |
| `hindsight_block_processing_seconds` | histogram | — |

A Grafana dashboard is provided at [`grafana/hindsight.json`](grafana/hindsight.json) — import it
and point it at your Prometheus datasource.

## Methodology

**Decoding.** For each block, Hindsight fetches all receipts in one `eth_getBlockReceipts` call and
matches transactions two ways: by entry point (`tx.to` is a known client or aggregator router) and
by log signature (a known aggregator contract emitted a log, catching filler-initiated intent
fills). Matched transactions are traced with `debug_traceTransaction` to recover native-ETH legs and
to attribute the settling aggregator by walking the call frames. The decode nets a party's ERC-20 and
native flow into `(token_in, amount_in, token_out, amount_out)`.

**Client vs aggregator.** A trade has two attribution levels: the **client** (the platform that
initiated it, e.g. Relay or Matcha — who Fynd is compared against) and the **aggregator** (the solver
the client routed through, e.g. 1inch or 0x — who to blame when a trade settled worse than Fynd).
When a user swaps directly through an aggregator router, client and aggregator are the same.

**Comparison.** Fynd's output is compared to the settled amount as a basis-point delta, both raw and
net of Fynd's estimated gas. A trade is a **win** when Fynd's net-of-gas output strictly exceeds the
settled amount, a **loss** otherwise, and **unsolvable** when Fynd cannot produce a quote (missing
token in Tycho, insufficient liquidity, timeout).

## Limitations

- **Two execution modes.** `resolve` compares at the chain's *current* state (re-solving through a
  separate running Fynd over HTTP). `monitor` provides the full top-of-block / back-of-block range
  via an in-process stepped solver. `monitor`'s end-to-end run is exercised by a gated integration
  test that needs a reachable Tycho endpoint (`TYCHO_URL` + `TYCHO_API_KEY`); the comparison/range
  logic is unit-tested independently.
- **USD savings need a stablecoin leg.** Savings are valued in USD (`hindsight_savings_usd`) when
  either leg is a known stablecoin: the output leg is taken at peg directly, or the input leg
  provides the trade's USD notional and the output delta is valued at the settled trade's implied
  price. Fynd exposes no public token→USD conversion, so trades with no stablecoin leg are reported
  in basis points and token amounts only; valuing those needs an external price feed.
- **Ethereum only.** The decoder targets Ethereum mainnet. Other chains are a `--chain` label on
  metrics but are not yet decoded.
- **Known decode gaps.** Log-silent protocols (e.g. ParaSwap Delta's canonical contract emits no
  log) are missed rather than guessed. WETH and native ETH are reported as distinct tokens. The
  maker-detection heuristic assumes an EOA maker. Uniswap Universal Router is treated as an
  aggregator. Missing some trades is acceptable for v0.
