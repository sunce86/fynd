//! Re-solve engine: run Fynd on a decoded swap's inputs and compare its output against what
//! actually settled on-chain.
//!
//! The [`ReSolver`] trait abstracts the solver so the comparison pipeline is testable without a
//! live Fynd instance. The production implementation ([`run`]) re-solves through a running Fynd
//! via the shared `FyndAggregator` (HTTP). This compares at the chain's current state; re-solving
//! at top-of-block (N-1) and back-of-block (N) as a range is a follow-up that depends on
//! block-stepping support (`BlockStepController`) being wired into `fynd-core`.
