//! Worker pool for processing solve tasks.
//!
//! The worker pool manages multiple dedicated OS threads for CPU-bound route finding.
//! Each pool owns multiple SolverWorker instances that compete for tasks from the queue.
//! A pool is configured with a specific algorithm (by name), allowing multiple pools
//! with different algorithms to compete via the WorkerPoolRouter.
//!
//! Pools can use either a built-in algorithm (by name via [`WorkerPoolBuilder::algorithm`])
//! or a custom [`Algorithm`](crate::algorithm::Algorithm) implementation (via
//! [`WorkerPoolBuilder::with_algorithm`]).
